  description: <p>Introduction</p>The evolution of Human Resource Management (HRM) theory and practice was influenced by economic and political factors in the 1980s, as noted by Rees (2014). With a wide scope that includes business policy, organizational behavior, international and intercultural management, and strategic management, HRM is a relatively new field that some organizations are still learning to fully understand and leverage. However, companies that effectively implement HRM practices can achieve flexibility, high performance, and competitive advantage, ultimately leading to increased value and profitability for the business and its shareholders.<p>HRM Foundation</p><p>HRM has become a global phenomenon and a recognized symbol for effective people management, as highlighted by Rees (2014). As a result, an increasing number of companies have placed greater emphasis on developing their HRM practices. The contributions of Professor Abraham Maslow and Professor Frederick Herzberg have been instrumental in shaping HRM theory and practice. Their motivational theories have been proven to increase both the quantity and quality of work in organizations. The Motivation Theory and Motivation-Hygiene Theory are widely applied in modern businesses and serve as the foundation for future HRM advancements. Any further developments in HRM are likely to build upon these models.</p><p>Theory of Motivation</p><p>According to Maslow&apos;s Hierarchy of Needs theory (Maslow 2000), human motivation is driven by five distinct levels of needs. These include physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs. Each level of need plays a critical role in shaping employees&apos; attitudes and motivation towards their work environment. By understanding and addressing these needs, organizations can effectively enhance employee engagement and productivity. Maslow&apos;s Hierarchy of Needs model provides valuable insights into the factors that motivate employees to achieve their goals. This model can be effectively utilized by HR departments to both attract and retain employees. For instance, an individual at the esteem level can be recognized and celebrated through public announcements or by featuring their picture on a hall of fame board. By addressing the specific needs of individuals at different stages of the hierarchy, HR departments can enhance employee satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately contributing to the long-term success of the organization.</p><img src="Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.png" style="width:100%;height:100%;">

  description: <p>Motivation-Hygiene Theory</p><p>Frederick Herzberg believed that humans are motivated by motivators and hygiene factors (Herzberg 1976). Thus, he proposed the motivation-hygiene theory. The factors for satisfaction (satisfiers such as achievement, responsibility, and growth) and the factors for dissatisfaction (dissatisfiers such as policy, salary, and relationship) can influence employees’ attitudes and motivations towards the workplace.</p><p><img src="Picture2.png" style="width:100%;height:100%;"></p><p>Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory demonstrates the reasons or factors that encourage employees to generate more output in terms of quality and quantity of work. This model can be utilized to manage the employees’ maximum input towards work. Employees would generally put more effort into their duties when they were satisfied with their situation.</p><p>Future HR</p><p>The combination of the theory of motivation and the motivation-hygiene theory laid the foundation for the future of HR. HR departments will have to be flexible with each employee. HR will have to perform surveys and screenings in order to find out the [who] correspond to [which] (which stage of Hierarchy of Needs is that individual). Then, HR will have to apply specific motivation factors or hygiene factors (from the Motivation-Hygiene Theory) to that targeted individual or employee (Hope, 2003). It is important and necessary to supply the right materials and contract that fulfill the needs of the individual because that’s how HR attracts and retains employees. It does not matter whether or not the organization uses traditional pay or non-traditional pay, as long as it fulfills the needs of an employee adequately. The organization obviously cannot fulfill an unreasonable need that is too vague and that hurts the organization, such as paying millions of dollars in salary to a janitor. By creating an employee-friendly environment and fulfilling an employee’s needs, the employees will feel a sense of belonging that is critical to an organization’s success (Rieger, 1995).</p><p>In general, the future of HR is to create an employee-friendly workplace. It is employee-oriented rather than focusing on profit as employees have a certain level of influence on the performance and income of an organization. The goal is to help employees gain satisfaction at work so that they will return the favor and put effort into work from the bottom of their hearts. When employees are passionate about their work, profit comes along. Maslow’s theory and Herzberg’s theory would be a necessary foundation for most of the companies. As different organizations have different cultures and missions, they would have to adjust accordingly. Organizations own different technologies and specialize in different industries, so there would be many different variations of the future of HR strategies, but all of them would be established on top of those two theories.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Companies achieve success, flexibility, high performance, and a competitive advantage through the correct HRM. Two theories that are important to the future of HRM are the theory of motivation and the motivation-hygiene theory. Companies in the future will apply these theories to their workers and reap the benefits by creating a sense of belonging in their workers through an employee-friendly workplace.</p>
