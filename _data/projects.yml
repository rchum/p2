  role1: The Future of HR <p>Introduction</p>
  description1: The development of human resource management (HRM) theory and practice is the result of economic and political factors in the 1980s (Rees 2014). HRM has a large coverage area in business generally that includes business policy, organizational behavior, international and intercultural management, and strategic management. Since HR is a fairly new subject, organizations do not have enough knowledge and information to determine the importance of HRM. However, some companies achieve flexibility, high performance, and competitive advantage through the correct HRM. This brings value and profit to the business and shareholders.
  
  role2: HRM Foundation
  description2: HRM has emerged as a global discourse and has become a recognized semiotic for ‘modern people management’ (Rees 2014). Consequently, more and more companies have started to pay attention to work on their HRM. Professor Abraham Maslow and Professor Frederick Herzberg both made contributions that are critical to the HRM. Their theories are proven to be true and effective towards motivating employees to increase the quantity of work and quality of work. Theory of Motivation and Motivation-Hygiene Theory both are widely integrated into organizations under the modern business world. These two theories are very important to HRM that they have laid a foundation for future HR. Any further improvement and advancement will most likely build on top of these models.
  
  role3: Theory of Motivation
  description3: Abraham Maslow believed that humans are motivated by five different levels of needs (Maslow 2000). Thus, he proposed Theory of Motivation. This Hierarchy of Needs model contains five levels of motivational needs – physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. These five stages of needs can influence employees’ attitude and motivation towards workplace. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs demonstrates the reasons/factors that motivate employees to achieve their needs. This model can be utilized to attract potential employees and retain current employees. HR department can target an individual who is at the esteem level by putting his/her picture in hall of fame or by congratulating him/her through an announcement. In this situation, the HR department provides what that individual needs and is also able to retain that individual to keep working for the organization.

  role4: Motivation-Hygiene Theory
  description4: Frederick Herzberg believed that humans are motivated by motivators and hygiene factors (Herzberg 1976). Thus, he proposed the motivation-hygiene theory. The factors for satisfaction (satisfiers such as achievement, responsibility, and growth) and the factors for dissatisfaction (dissatisfiers such as policy, salary, and relationship) can influence employees’ attitudes and motivations towards the workplace. Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory demonstrates the reasons or factors that encourage employees to generate more output in terms of quality and quantity of work. This model can be utilized to manage the employees’ maximum input towards work. Employees would generally put more effort into their duties when they were satisfied with their situation.

role5: Future HR
  description5: The combination of the theory of motivation and the motivation-hygiene theory laid the foundation for the future of HR. HR departments will have to be flexible with each employee. HR will have to perform surveys and screenings in order to find out "who" corresponds to "which" (which stage of the hierarchy of needs is that individual). Then, HR will have to apply specific motivation factors or hygiene factors (from the Motivation-Hygiene Theory) to that targeted individual or employee (Hope, 2003). It is important and necessary to supply the right materials and contract that fulfill the needs of the individual because that’s how HR attracts and retains employees. It does not matter whether or not the organization uses traditional pay or non-traditional pay, as long as it fulfills the needs of an employee adequately. The organization obviously cannot fulfill an unreasonable need that is too vague and that hurts the organization, such as paying millions of dollars in salary to a janitor. By creating an employee-friendly environment and fulfilling an employee’s needs, the employees will feel a sense of belonging that is critical to an organization’s success (Rieger, 1995).

<p>In general, the future of HR is to create an employee-friendly workplace. It is employee-oriented rather than focusing on profit as employees have a certain level of influence on the performance and income of an organization. The goal is to help employees gain satisfaction at work so that they will return the favor and put effort into work from the bottom of their hearts. When employees are passionate about their work, profit comes along. Maslow’s theory and Herzberg’s theory would be a necessary foundation for most of the companies. As different organizations have different cultures and missions, they would have to adjust accordingly. Organizations own different technologies and specialize in different industries, so there would be many different variations of the future of HR strategies, but all of them would be established on top of those two theories.</p>
  
  role6: Conclusion
  description6: Companies achieve success, flexibility, high performance, and a competitive advantage through the correct HRM. Two theories that are important to the future of HRM are the Theory of Motivation and the Motivation-Hygiene Theory. Companies in the future will apply these theories to their workers and reap the benefits by creating a sense of belonging in their workers through an employee friendly workplace.
