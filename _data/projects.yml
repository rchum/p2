  role1: Introduction
  description1: The development of human resource management (HRM) theory and practice is the result of economic and political factors in the 1980s (Rees 2014). HRM has a large coverage area in business generally that includes business policy, organizational behavior, international and intercultural management, and strategic management. Since HR is a fairly new subject, organizations do not have enough knowledge and information to determine the importance of HRM. However, some companies achieve flexibility, high performance, and competitive advantage through the correct HRM. This brings value and profit to the business and shareholders.
  
  role2: HRM Foundation
  description2: HRM has emerged as a global discourse and has become a recognized semiotic for ‘modern people management’ (Rees 2014). Consequently, more and more companies have started to pay attention to work on their HRM. Professor Abraham Maslow and Professor Frederick Herzberg both made contributions that are critical to the HRM. Their theories are proven to be true and effective towards motivating employees to increase the quantity of work and quality of work. Theory of Motivation and Motivation-Hygiene Theory both are widely integrated into organizations under the modern business world. These two theories are very important to HRM that they have laid a foundation for future HR. Any further improvement and advancement will most likely build on top of these models.
  
  role3: Theory of Motivation
  description3: Abraham Maslow believed that humans are motivated by five different levels of needs (Maslow 2000). Thus, he proposed Theory of Motivation. This Hierarchy of Needs model contains five levels of motivational needs – physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. These five stages of needs can influence employees’ attitude and motivation towards workplace.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs demonstrates the reasons/factors that motivate employees to achieve their needs. This model can be utilized to attract potential employees and retain current employees. HR department can target an individual who is at the esteem level by putting his/her picture in hall of fame or by congratulating him/her through an announcement. In this situation, the HR department provides what that individual needs and is also able to retain that individual to keep working for the organization.

 # role4: Motivation-Hygiene Theory
  #description4: Frederick Herzberg believed that humans are motivated by motivators and hygiene factors (Herzberg 1976). Thus, he proposed the motivation-hygiene theory. The factors for satisfaction (satisfiers such as achievement, responsibility, and growth) and the factors for dissatisfaction (dissatisfiers such as policy, salary, and relationship) can influence employees’ attitudes and motivations towards the workplace.

Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory demonstrates the reasons or factors that encourage employees to generate more output in terms of quality and quantity of work. This model can be utilized to manage the employees’ maximum input towards work. Employees would generally put more effort into their duties when they were satisfied with their situation.
